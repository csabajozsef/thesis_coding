# Graph embeddings and their applications - Matematics BSc thesis

## Content

This repo contains all the code used in the thesis.
The thesis includes two tasks, the first one is a node classification using node2vec and GraphSage, the second one is testing the runtimes of the algorithms on artifically created graphs.These are named experiment one and two in the folder system.
The [thesis](/Full%20thesis%20-%20Gráfbeágyazások%20és%20alkalmazásaik.pdf) is written in Hungarian; however, an English [summary](/Thesis%20summary%20(English).pdf) is also available.

## The sources

The two main papers I used for the thesis are the introductory paper on [node2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653) and [GraphSAGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216)
The other citations can be found at the end of the Hungarian version of the thesis.

## How to use this repo

The code can be run with Python 3.10.4.
The current version runs on CPU, the CUDA version of the code is yet to be added.
The /src folder contains modules that were used to work with graph data. These files are stil WIP.
